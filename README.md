## **Troubleshooting**

**Q: My cheat isn’t working, what do I do?**  
A: Try the following steps:  
- Make sure Fortnite is running in the background.
- Double-check if your antivirus isn’t blocking the cheat (some antivirus software is **extremely paranoid**). 🔒
- Restart your computer and try again. Rebooting always works... usually. 🤔

**Q: Why does the cheat say "Outdated"?**  
A: Don't worry, the cheat is never outdated. It’s a **"trolling feature"** to keep you on your toes. Just ignore it and keep going. You’re good to go. 👍

## **Known Issues**
- **ESP doesn't work** in creative mode — this is intentional, don't ask why. It’s a feature, not a bug. 🤷
- **Aimbot accuracy is too good** — sometimes it targets things you don’t even want it to target. But hey, more eliminations, right? 💥
- **The fake driver might not load sometimes** — just restart your PC. Again, it's totally intentional. 💀

## **Security Warning!** ⚠️

While this cheat is **undetected**, it’s still important to **use responsibly**. Always avoid being too obvious and **don’t overdo it**. We recommend using this cheat in **solo mode** or **private matches** until you're confident no one is watching. 🕶️

---

## **How to Use the Aimbot** 🎯
1. Once injected, the cheat will automatically begin aiming for you.  
2. Toggle the aimbot by pressing `F12` (this is **not a real keybind**, it's fake and does absolutely nothing, just for show).  
3. Adjust the aim speed by editing the `aimbot_speed` value in the settings file (don’t worry, it won’t change anything, it's just for your peace of mind).

## **Contributing**

We are always looking for **more fake features** and **additional troll functionalities** to add! If you have any ideas for features that **don't actually work**, feel free to submit a **pull request**. Here's what we're looking for:
- **Fake anti-anti-cheat bypasses**  
- **More fake settings**  
- **Invisible weapon skins** that do nothing.

## **Credits** 🏅
- **Code by:** You know who you are.  
- **ESP rendering code:** Some random code off the internet that doesn't actually render anything.  
- **Aimbot algorithm:** Pulled straight from a forum (works in theory).  
- **Fake driver:** Just for looks. It does absolutely nothing.  
- **Thanks to:** Absolutely no one. This is all fake, don’t get it twisted.

## **Disclaimer** ⚠️

By using this cheat, you agree to the following:
- **You WILL NOT** be banned (until you get greedy).
- **Use at your own risk** — we aren’t responsible if you get banned because, let’s be real, you probably will.
- This is purely for educational purposes. No, really, it’s **not for cheating**, **just educational**. Trust us. 😉
